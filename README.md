# TimeKill

This project serves as a playground for exploring and gaining experience with the Vulkan API. It is purely experimental and does not have any specific goals or a planned roadmap. The focus is on learning and experimenting with Vulkan's features, architecture, and capabilities.

Feel free to browse the code and use it as a reference or inspiration for your own Vulkan experiments!
